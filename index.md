This is a architecture blueprint for modern frontend frameworks which works with definitely works with VueJs and Flutter.
I use both in projects but the architecture probably also works with other frameworks especially React and Svelte.

The whole architecture is highly opinionated to my personal knowledge and experience in both frameworks.
Because languages, frameworks and my opinion changes over time, this architecture is work in progress.
I do **not** claim that this works for everyone and every project, but it works for all projects that i encountered so far.
